          It was a cold Saturday morning. I was at a conference in Germany and started to feel very sick. I could barely
          move, but I had to take a plane to speak at another conference in Spain. In the middle of the flight, I called
          the flight attendant and said I needed help. The airplane landed, and I left there in an ambulance.
